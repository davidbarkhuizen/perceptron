    The standard logistic sigmoid, 1/(1+e^-z) - the textbook formula directly, except caught
    against the OverflowError math.exp(-z) raises for z below about -709 (confirmed directly:
    math.exp(710) raises OverflowError, math.exp(700) doesn't) - a real, reachable value for a
    node whose weighted input sum has drifted large and negative during training, not just a
    theoretical edge case. Deliberately not the usual piecewise e^z/(1+e^z) reformulation for
    z < 0: that avoids the overflow too, but rounds differently from 1/(1+e^-z) across the
    entire negative range, not just the extreme tail - which would silently perturb every
    already-passing seeded/pinned training result in this codebase's tests, for a discrepancy
    that only actually matters in the (unreached, in practice) extreme tail. In that tail,
    1/(1+e^-z) is mathematically indistinguishable from 0.0 in float64 anyway (e^-z is already
    astronomically larger than 1), so catching the overflow and returning that same limiting
    value exactly reproduces what the direct formula would have computed had it not overflowed.
