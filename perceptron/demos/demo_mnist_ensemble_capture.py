# mnist_capture.preprocess_capture): the user paints a binary CAPTURE_GRID_SIZE x
# CAPTURE_GRID_SIZE bitmap by mouse (each stroke stamped CAPTURE_BRUSH_RADIUS cells wide, via
# mnist_capture.paint_brush_stroke - a single-cell-wide mouse line is far thinner than any real
# digit stroke once cropped and scaled down), which is then genuinely cropped to its own bounding
# box, aspect-preserving-anti-aliased-scaled to fit a 20px box, and center-of-mass-placed into a
# 28x28 field. See perceptron/demos/capture_app.py for the shared capture UI this config drives.
