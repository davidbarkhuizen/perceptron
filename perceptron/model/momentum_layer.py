    Returns a BackpropNode subclass whose apply_gradient adds the momentum term from Rumelhart,
    Hinton & Williams (1986)'s own generalized delta rule - Δw(n) = η·δ·a + α·Δw(n-1) - which
    BackpropNode.apply_gradient never had. Each node tracks its own previous weight/bias delta
    (zero-initialized) and folds momentum * that previous delta into the current step, then
    remembers the new delta for next time.

    A factory, not a fixed class, because momentum is a genuinely tunable coefficient - unlike
    every other node variant in this codebase (softmax, cross-entropy, ReLU), which differ by a
    fixed formula with no free parameter, there is no single momentum value this codebase's own
    measurements support recommending as a default (see docs/research-and-analysis.md's
    "momentum" entry: the canonical α=0.9 robustly hurt across a learning-rate sweep, and no
    coefficient in 0.3-0.7 measurably beat no momentum at all, once enough seeds ruled out noise).
