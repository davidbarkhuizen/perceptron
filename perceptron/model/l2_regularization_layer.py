    """
    Returns a BackpropNode subclass whose apply_gradient adds an L2 (weight decay) penalty term
    to every incoming weight's update: minimizing C + (l2_lambda/2)*sum(w^2) instead of just C
    adds l2_lambda*w to that weight's gradient, so the update becomes
    w -= learning_rate*(delta*input_value + l2_lambda*w) - equivalently, an extra multiplicative
    shrinkage of w by (1 - learning_rate*l2_lambda) on top of the ordinary gradient step, which is
    where "weight decay" gets its name.

    Deliberately does NOT regularize bias - standard practice (e.g. Goodfellow, Bengio &
    Courville's Deep Learning, ch. 7): penalizing bias doesn't serve L2's actual purpose
    (discouraging large weights, which is what actually controls a model's effective
    complexity) and can needlessly hurt fitting the intercept, since a large bias isn't itself a
    sign of overfitting the way large weights are.

    A factory, not a fixed class, for the same reason as make_momentum_node_cls: there is no
    single l2_lambda value this codebase has measured and can recommend - see
    docs/research-and-analysis.md's "L2 weight regularization" entry.
