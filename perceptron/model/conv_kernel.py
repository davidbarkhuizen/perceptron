class ConvKernel:
    """
    One convolutional output channel's shared, trainable weights - a flat kernel_size x
    kernel_size weight list plus a bias, referenced by every ConvUnit (one per output spatial
    position) in that channel, not owned independently by any of them. See
    docs/convolutional-layers.md's "the architectural point that matters more than any single
    function" for why this is a separate class from BackpropNode rather than a subclass of it:
    BackpropNode's input_node_weights is an owned, rebindable instance attribute, which fights a
    weight list many instances need to read and update identically, rather than accommodating
    it.

    accumulate_gradient()/apply_accumulated_gradient() mirror BackpropNode's own pair
    (perceptron/model/backprop_node.py) exactly, but are invoked differently: once per
    *contributing spatial position* (every ConvUnit in this channel, for every training example
    in a mini-batch) rather than once per training example, and applied once per *kernel*
    rather than once per node. Every position's contribution is summed into the same
    accumulator with no separate averaging - only apply_accumulated_gradient's own division by
    batch_size (the mini-batch size, not the position count) happens, so spatial contributions
    are summed and mini-batch examples are averaged, composing the two dimensions correctly.
