# Captures a digit the same way the reference work behind the bundled training data did (see
# digit_capture.downsample_to_target_grid): the user paints a binary CAPTURE_GRID_SIZE x
# CAPTURE_GRID_SIZE bitmap by mouse (mirroring NIST's own thresholded pen-on-paper scan) - each
# stroke stamped CAPTURE_BRUSH_RADIUS cells wide (see digit_capture.paint_brush_stroke), since a
# single-cell-wide mouse line comes out far fainter after downsampling than any real training
# stroke - which is then genuinely block-counted down to the GRID_SIZE x GRID_SIZE, 0-16-graded
# shape the model was actually trained on. See perceptron/demos/capture_app.py for the shared
# capture UI this config drives.
