  graphics/
    chart.py                      matplotlib helpers: figures/axes, decision-boundary and
                                   training-data plotting, and expanding plot bounds to

  geometry.py                     matplotlib-free geometry: intersecting a classifier's
                                   hidden-node half-planes to find its positive region, test
                                   whether that region is bounded and get a tight box around
                                   it, plus a symmetric input-bounds constructor

  evaluate.py                     comparing/measuring classifiers: class-balanced sampling
                                   (efficiently, using geometry.py's tight box around the
                                   positive region when available), sampling a point and
                                   classifying it with two networks, a permutation-invariant
                                   class-balanced disagreement metric, and series smoothing
  digits_data.py                  loads/normalizes the bundled 8x8 digits dataset, plus a
                                   train/test split (a fixed finite dataset, unlike every other
                                   target here, which is continuously re-sampleable)
  multiclass_evaluate.py          confusion_matrix and accuracy against a held-out test set -
                                   evaluate.py's functions are two-class- and geometry-specific
                                   and don't generalize to this
  digit_capture.py                pure helpers for the interactive digit-capture tool: maps a
                                   mouse pixel coordinate to a tile, stamps a realistically
                                   pen-thick brush stroke (not a single mouse-cell), genuinely
                                   reproduces the reference work's own 32x32-to-8x8
                                   block-counting downsample, and flattens the resulting 8x8
                                   grid into the same state shape digits_data.py produces
  mnist_data.py                   loads the real MNIST dataset: a one-time convert_parquet_to_binary
                                   conversion (pyarrow imported locally, only for that conversion)
                                   to a flat, header-less binary format, then label-only
                                   (load_mnist_labels) and indexed-record (load_mnist_records_at_indices,
                                   direct seek - decodes only what's asked for) readers that
                                   together let ensemble training avoid ever fully decoding the
                                   dataset in any one process (see research-and-analysis.md)
  ensemble_train.py                builds each class's balanced binary dataset from label data
                                   alone (select_balanced_indices/build_balanced_binary_dataset),
                                   then trains all class_count classifiers as fully independent
                                   multiprocessing jobs with no synchronization between them -
                                   train_ensemble_parallel (small datasets, fully in memory) and
                                   train_ensemble_parallel_from_indices (large datasets - each
                                   worker loads only its own selected records, itself); a
                                   memory-aware worker count (_select_worker_count) caps the pool
                                   by available memory as well as CPU count
  mnist_capture.py                 pure helpers for the interactive MNIST-capture tool: genuinely
                                   reproduces MNIST's own reference preprocessing (crop to
                                   bounding box -> aspect-preserving anti-aliased scale-to-20 via
                                   area-weighted resampling -> center-of-mass placement into 28x28
                                   - see resize_area_weighted, scale_to_fit, center_of_mass,
                                   place_centered, preprocess_capture), plus a brush-stroke helper
                                   for the 64x64 capture grid (independent of, not shared with,
                                   digit_capture.py's - the two pipelines' grid sizes and
                                   downstream processing differ enough to not be worth unifying)
  demos/
    menu.py                                      the . cli demo entrypoint: a text REPL that lists every demo

                                                 longer description, runs it, then loops back until you quit -
                                                 or pass a demo number directly (. cli demo 3) to skip the menu
                                                 and run just that one demo
    registry.py                                  the DEMOS list menu.py renders and runs: each entry's module
                                                 path, title, one-line summary and longer description

                                                 demo_mnist_ensemble_capture.py both configure and call
    demo_minimum_disturbance_training.py         standalone script that trains a classifier and plots the
                                                 result, showcasing the minimum-disturbance multi-unit learning
                                                 rule at cardinality=4
    demo_linear_classifier_cardinality_sweep.py  trains classifiers at several cardinalities and compares
                                                 convergence
    demo_unreachable_class_safety_guard.py       shows random_alternating_training_data's max_attempts guard

    demo_xor_linear_classifier_ceiling.py        trains against a target no required_active/cardinality can
                                                 represent
    demo_xor_backprop_convergence.py             trains a BackpropClassifierNetwork on the same target - and
                                                 converges
    demo_backprop_stripes_architecture_sweep.py  compares single- vs two-hidden-layer
                                                 BackpropClassifierNetworks at matched node budgets, on a
                                                 harder-than-XOR striped target
    demo_backprop_circular_boundary.py           trains against a circular target - a genuinely curved
                                                 boundary, unlike any LinearClassifierNetwork's polygon
    demo_backprop_linear_parity_check.py         parity check: both models on the same easy, linearly-separable

    demo_uci_digit_recognition.py                classic-style handwritten digit recognition on the bundled 8x8

`LinearClassifierNetwork` composes:

- an **input layer** (`StateLayer`) of raw input values,
- a **hidden layer** of `cardinality` `AssociationNode`s, each fully connected to the input layer,
- a single-node **output layer** that fires once at least `required_active` of the hidden
  layer's nodes are active (via weights of 1 and a threshold of `-(required_active - 1)`).
  `required_active` defaults to `cardinality` (AND: every hidden node must agree); passing 1
  gives OR (any one is enough), and anything in between gives a general k-of-n gate, in the
  spirit of a MADALINE-style committee machine. `geometry.py`'s positive-region functions
  only support the AND case (`required_active == cardinality`) and `dimension == 2` - the
  true positive region under any other gate is a union of intersections, not a single
  intersection, and a higher dimension needs more than just the first two weights it reads -
  and those functions raise rather than silently return a wrong answer if called on one.

Each `AssociationNode` updates via the perceptron learning rule
(`w += learning_rate * (reference - actual) * input`), and `train.py` drives this over a
shuffled, class-balanced set of training examples generated from a reference classifier. On
a misclassification, `LinearClassifierNetwork.learn()` doesn't update every hidden node —
it picks the single node closest to flipping (smallest `|z()|`) among those responsible for
the error, a minimum-disturbance rule in the spirit of Widrow's MADALINE, needed once
`cardinality > 1` so hidden nodes can specialize into different half-planes instead of all
converging to the same one. This selection is combination-gate-agnostic: it only relies on
the output being a monotonically non-decreasing function of how many hidden nodes are
active, which holds for AND, OR, or any k-of-n `required_active` - so `learn()` needed no
changes to support gates other than AND.

Unlike the single-neuron case (see [theory](theory.md)), this
has no convergence guarantee analogous to Rosenblatt's theorem — there's no proof it finds a
matching set of hyperplanes in finite steps, or at all, for an arbitrary target polytope. In
practice it converges well for modest cardinality (see `tests/test_training_pipeline.py`'s
cardinality=2 case), but that's an empirical observation, not a theorem.

Because of that, `train.train_linear_classifier_network` uses a pocket-algorithm-style
"keep the best, not the latest" rule: training accuracy on `training_data` is measured after
every epoch, and the student is left at whichever epoch's weights scored best, not
necessarily the raw last epoch's - a no-op when training does converge (the best epoch is
then the last one), and a real difference when it doesn't (see
[demos](demos.md#demo-xor-linear-classifier-ceiling)). It returns a `ConvergenceSeries` - the
same list of `(iteration, disagreement_rate)` pairs it's always returned, so every existing
use keeps working unchanged, plus a `.diagnostic` (a `TrainingDiagnostic`) that answers,
without needing to eyeball a chart, whether that run `.converged` (every training example
correctly classified), `.plateaued` (the best epoch wasn't the last one - more epochs
already stopped helping), or was `.still_improving` (the last epoch was still the best one
seen, just not there yet).

`LinearClassifierNetwork.randomize()` scales each hidden node's weight range inversely with
its own dimension's `input_bounds` half-width (and leaves the threshold range fixed) so that
a random hidden node has a similar chance of splitting the input space regardless of how
large, small, or asymmetric `input_bounds` is - a fixed weight range would let the threshold
dominate at small bounds scales, making almost every random classifier permanently one
class.

`evaluate.sample_class_balanced_states` (used by both `random_alternating_training_data` and
`class_balanced_disagreement_rate`) draws positive-class points from a tight box around the
classifier's own positive region (`geometry.positive_region_bounding_box`) instead of
rejection-sampling all of `input_bounds`, when that box is computable. A classifier's positive
region can be a tiny fraction of `input_bounds` - measured empirically: often under 1% of the
box's area at cardinality 4 with the bounded-region requirement, as low as 0.02%, shrinking
further as cardinality grows - so naive full-box rejection sampling can need far more attempts
than `max_attempts` allows, wasting the whole budget on candidates a tighter box would have
made trivial. Falls back to `input_bounds` (byte-for-byte the previous behaviour) whenever no
tight box is computable - cardinality 1-2 (never bounded), a non-AND `required_active`, or a
classifier that isn't a `LinearClassifierNetwork` at all (both functions accept anything with
the same `input_bounds`/`classify_state` interface, e.g. `demo_xor_linear_classifier_ceiling.py`'s
`XORTarget`).

## backprop

`BackpropClassifierNetwork` is an additive alternative to `LinearClassifierNetwork`, not a
retrofit of it - `AssociationNode`'s hard step function and discrete minimum-disturbance update
rule are fundamentally different from gradient-based learning. It composes `BackpropNode`s
(sigmoid activation, `a = 1/(1+e^-z)`) into `BackpropLayer`s of arbitrary depth
(`input -> hidden layer(s) -> a trainable single-node output layer`). Unlike
`LinearClassifierNetwork`'s output layer (fixed weights of `1.0` per hidden node, so its output
can only be a monotonically non-decreasing function of how many hidden nodes fire -
see `demo_xor_linear_classifier_ceiling.py`), every layer here is trained, including the output layer,
so a hidden node can push the output either way. That's what lets it represent targets like XOR
that no `required_active`/`cardinality` combination can (see `demo_xor_backprop_convergence.py`).

Learning uses mean-squared-error, back-propagated by hand (no autodiff): at the output node,
`delta = (a - y) * a * (1-a)`; at a hidden node, `delta = (Σ downstream delta * weight) *
a * (1-a)` - the same shape at every layer, one rule applied throughout, in the same
first-principles spirit as [theory](theory.md). Each node caches its activation via an explicit
`forward()` pass (`value()` is a pure cache read) so a downstream node's multiple reads of an
upstream node don't each re-pay for a fresh sigmoid evaluation. `randomize()` must give every
node in a layer independent random weights - unlike `AssociationNode`'s harmless identical
default weights, identical starting weights here would give every node in a layer identical
gradients forever, collapsing it to one effective unit.

`train_linear_classifier_network` (see above) trains a `BackpropClassifierNetwork` completely
unchanged - it only ever calls `.learn()`, `.snapshot()`/`.restore()` (renamed from
`LinearClassifierNetwork`'s original `hidden_layer_snapshot`/`restore_hidden_layer` for exactly
this reason), and `.classify_state()`, all of which both classes implement. The two classes'
`.snapshot()` shapes differ (flat, hidden-layer-only for `LinearClassifierNetwork`; nested,
covering every trainable layer including the output layer for `BackpropClassifierNetwork`) but
the training loop only ever treats the snapshot as opaque, so this is invisible to it.

## backprop siblings

Five additive siblings of `BackpropClassifierNetwork` exist alongside it - each isolating one
axis of variation (init scheme, hidden-layer activation, output loss, optimizer, regularization),
none replacing it or changing any existing demo, and each backed by a real measurement in
[research and analysis](research-and-analysis.md) rather than assumed to help:

- **`FanInAwareBackpropClassifierNetwork`** swaps in the same fan-in-aware `randomize()` scheme
  `MultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork` already uses (below) instead of
  `BackpropClassifierNetwork`'s own per-dimension-bounds-width scaling. This is the one adopted
  by default: `EnsembleBackpropClassifierNetwork` (below) is built from this class, not plain
  `BackpropClassifierNetwork` - switching alone, no other change, took the real MNIST ensemble
  from 89.4% to 96.01% held-out test accuracy (see "the ensemble/real-MNIST investigation").
- **`ReLUBackpropClassifierNetwork`** replaces sigmoid with ReLU (`max(0, z)`, see `relu_layer.py`)
  for every hidden layer only - the output layer is untouched, since ReLU is a hidden-layer-only
  convention. At `BackpropClassifierNetwork`'s own tuned learning rate it loses badly (dead ReLU
  units were checked directly as the obvious explanation, and ruled out); retuned to its own
  learning rate, it doesn't just recover, it exceeds the sigmoid baseline (99.27% vs 97.80% mean
  on a fixed XOR scenario - see "ReLU hidden-layer activation").
- **`BinaryCrossEntropyBackpropClassifierNetwork`** replaces quadratic loss with binary
  cross-entropy at the output node (`self.delta = self.value() - reference_value`, no `a(1-a)`
  factor) - the canonical loss for binary classification. Needs its own, substantially lower,
  learning rate to match (not beat) the quadratic baseline's tuned performance - see "binary
  cross-entropy for BackpropClassifierNetwork".
- **`MomentumBackpropClassifierNetwork`** adds the momentum term from Rumelhart, Hinton &
  Williams (1986)'s own generalized delta rule, which `apply_gradient` never had before this.
  Sets both `hidden_layer_cls` and `output_layer_cls` - unlike the three above (each touching
  only one layer or the other), this changes the weight-update rule itself, shared by every
  trainable layer. Unlike the other four, no `momentum` coefficient tested actually beat plain
  SGD - the constructor requires an explicit value rather than defaulting to one, and this class
  was kept mainly for a future mini-batch-gradient investigation, where momentum's own literature
  is more commonly validated (see "momentum").
- **`L2RegularizedBackpropClassifierNetwork`** sets both hooks the same way, for the same
  reason - it adds an `l2_lambda * weight` penalty to every weight's gradient (never bias -
  standard practice). Measured on a small, fixed, finite proxy dataset rather than a toy
  geometric target, since L2's whole purpose is generalization: no coefficient tested improved
  held-out accuracy above the unregularized baseline, though the mechanism itself was confirmed
  directly (a strong enough penalty collapses the network to a constant prediction, weights
  decayed to near-zero - see "L2 weight regularization").

Of these five, two (`FanInAware...`, `ReLU...`) are genuine, measured improvements over the
plain sigmoid/quadratic-loss/no-momentum/no-regularization baseline; one
(`BinaryCrossEntropy...`) matches it once retuned; two (`Momentum...`, `L2Regularized...`) are
kept as real, tested capabilities despite measuring as nulls on the scenarios tested, not
because either is recommended for use today. `demo_backprop_variant_comparison.py` reproduces
three of these comparisons (one-vs-rest vs softmax, quadratic vs binary cross-entropy,
fan-in-aware vs Xavier/Glorot init - see [demos](demos.md#demo-backprop-variant-comparison)) live
and re-runnably, rather than leaving the documented numbers only readable.

## multi-class

`MultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork` is a one-vs-rest multi-class sibling of
`BackpropClassifierNetwork`, built entirely on the same `BackpropNode`/`BackpropLayer` blocks -
a new class rather than a retrofit, because `classify_state()`'s return type changes (a class
index, not a 0.0/1.0 float), and every existing backprop demo depends on the binary contract.
Its output layer has `class_count` nodes instead of one; each is trained independently against
a one-hot target (`BackpropNode.compute_output_delta` needed no changes for this - it was
already a per-node, sibling-independent computation), and the predicted class at inference is
whichever output node has the highest activation.

Its `randomize()` uses **fan-in-aware** initialization (`limit = 1/sqrt(fan_in)`) rather than
`BackpropClassifierNetwork.randomize()`'s per-dimension-bounds-width scaling - that scaling was
tuned for 1-2D geometric problems and produces exploding pre-activation sums (guaranteed sigmoid
saturation at every node) once fan-in reaches the tens or hundreds, as it does for a 64-pixel
digit image. Also new: `save()`/`load()` (plain JSON) - trained-model persistence, so a trained
network can be reused without retraining.

`SoftmaxMultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork` is an additive sibling of
`MultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork` using softmax + cross-entropy instead of one-vs-rest
sigmoid + quadratic loss - the canonical treatment for a mutually-exclusive multi-class target
like digit classification (see `docs/research-and-analysis.md`'s "softmax/cross-entropy
re-alignment" entry for the full derivation and measured comparison). Structurally it's a single
class-attribute override (`output_layer_cls = SoftmaxOutputLayer`, see
`perceptron/model/softmax_output_layer.py`) - softmax's cross-node coupling only touches the
forward pass (each node's activation needs every sibling's pre-activation `z`), so
`BackpropNetworkBase`'s existing backward-pass plumbing needed no changes at all; the
softmax+cross-entropy output delta (`activation - target`) is exactly as per-node-independent
as `MultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork`'s own one-vs-rest delta. `EnsembleBackpropClassifierNetwork`
(below) is deliberately untouched by this - its own one-vs-rest design is a different,
independently-motivated tradeoff (parallelizability across completely independent processes),
not a literature-alignment gap.

`digits_data.py` bundles a small, classic dataset - the UCI ML hand-written digits set (8x8
pixel images, 10 classes, 1797 samples), extracted once, offline, from
`sklearn.datasets.load_digits()` into `data/digits/digits.csv`. scikit-learn was only ever a
throwaway extraction tool; there's no runtime dependency on it, just a flat CSV and a small
parser. This is a fixed, finite, already-labeled dataset, unlike every other target in this
codebase (which are all continuously re-sampleable geometric regions) - hence `split_train_test`
(new) and `multiclass_evaluate.py`'s `confusion_matrix`/`accuracy` (new; `evaluate.py`'s
functions are two-class- and geometry-specific and don't generalize here).
`train_linear_classifier_network` still needs no changes at all - it only calls `.learn()`,
`.snapshot()`/`.restore()`, and `.classify_state()` (via `_training_accuracy`'s bare `==` check,
which works identically whether `category` is a float or an int).

`demo_uci_digit_capture.py` classifies a live, mouse-painted digit with a trained model loaded from
disk (`MultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork.load`). Rather than painting an 8x8 grid directly (an
earlier version of this tool did, first with binary tiles, then with an ad-hoc soft-brush
heuristic to fake grading), it genuinely reproduces the reference work behind the bundled
training data: the dataset's own description (`sklearn.datasets.load_digits()`) states "32x32
bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in
each block" to produce the 8x8, 0-16-graded shape `data/digits/digits.csv` actually contains. So
the tool captures a binary 32x32 bitmap by mouse (mirroring NIST's own thresholded scan) and
`digit_capture.downsample_to_target_grid` genuinely block-counts it down the same way, rather
than approximating grading with a heuristic - shown live in a second preview canvas (rendered via
`digit_capture.intensity_to_color`, a linear grayscale mapping) so what the classifier actually
sees is visible. The result still goes through `digit_capture.tile_grid_to_state` - the same
row-major, `[0.0, 1.0]`-normalized shape `digits_data.py` produces - unchanged by this.

Painting a single 32x32 cell per mouse event isn't enough, though - measured directly: a
mouse-thin (1-cell-wide) stroke block-counts down to only ~25% of full intensity, far fainter
than any real training example (which run ~14-16 out of 16 throughout their stroked regions,
since a real pen stroke is proportionally thick relative to the 32x32 capture resolution, not
single-pixel-thin). This was a real, reported bug - almost every digit misclassified toward
whichever class happened to catch faint, ambiguous input (in practice, nearly always "7") -
fixed by `digit_capture.paint_brush_stroke`, which stamps a `CAPTURE_BRUSH_RADIUS`-wide square
per stroke instead of one cell. That radius (2, a 5x5 stamp) was chosen empirically: wide enough
to reach near-full block intensity, but not so wide it fills in a real digit's negative space -
e.g. an unfilled "0"'s hole, which a radius of 3+ visibly started doing in testing.

`demo_mnist_ensemble_recognition.py` trains on the real, full-scale MNIST dataset (28x28, 60000 train /
10000 test images) rather than the small bundled UCI set, using
`EnsembleBackpropClassifierNetwork` instead of `MultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork` - 10
completely independent `FanInAwareBackpropClassifierNetwork`s (see "backprop siblings" above; a
`classifier_cls` parameter on `ensemble_train.py`'s training functions, defaulting to plain
`BackpropClassifierNetwork`, is what lets this demo opt into the fan-in-aware sibling without
touching any other caller), one per digit, each trained on its own class-balanced binary dataset
(`ensemble_train.build_balanced_binary_dataset`) with no shared hidden layer and no
synchronization of any kind between them, dispatched as parallel `multiprocessing` jobs
(`ensemble_train.train_ensemble_parallel_from_indices`). This design, and the real
memory-exhaustion bug hit (and fixed) while building it at full scale, is written up in
[research and analysis](research-and-analysis.md#parallelizing-mnist-training). The switch to
fan-in-aware init - the same fix "backprop siblings" describes - took this demo's own measured
result from 89.4% to 96.01% held-out test accuracy at the same wall-clock cost (~30 minutes,
measured directly at 29.6 minutes for the current configuration - see [research and
analysis](research-and-analysis.md#the-ensemblereal-mnist-investigation)).

`demo_mnist_ensemble_capture.py` classifies a live, mouse-painted digit with `EnsembleBackpropClassifierNetwork.load`
(the model the demo above trains and saves), the same overall interaction as
`demo_uci_digit_capture.py` but against MNIST's own reference preprocessing instead of the UCI
dataset's block-counting downsample: the user paints a binary 64x64 bitmap
(`mnist_capture.CAPTURE_GRID_SIZE`, deliberately higher resolution than the UCI tool's 32x32, so
there's real room for aspect-preserving scaling to do something meaningful), then
`mnist_capture.preprocess_capture` genuinely reproduces MNIST's own three-step pipeline - crop to
the drawn content's bounding box, aspect-preserving anti-aliased scale so the longer side hits 20
pixels, center-of-mass placement into a 28x28 field - shown live in a second preview canvas.
`CAPTURE_BRUSH_RADIUS` (4, a 9x9 stamp) was chosen empirically against the real trained ensemble
the same way `digit_capture.CAPTURE_BRUSH_RADIUS` was: tested against hand-simulated "0"/"1"/"7"
strokes, confidence stayed at ~1.00 through radius 2-5, degraded from radius 6 onward as a "0"'s
hole started filling in (0.94 at 6, 0.34 at 8, misclassified as "8" by 12) - 4 sits comfortably in
the safe range. Building this demo surfaced a real floating-point bug: `resize_area_weighted`'s
area-weighted average can overshoot its mathematically-guaranteed `[0.0, 1.0]` bound by a tiny
amount (observed directly: `1.0000000000000002`) from summing many small overlap contributions,
which `intensity_to_color`'s strict range assertion then rejected - `scale_to_fit` now clamps its
result (not the general-purpose `resize_area_weighted` itself, whose valid output range depends
on its caller's own input range).

## possible next steps

Recommendations from an audit-driven review of this codebase (see `research-and-analysis.md`
for the investigations that shaped the architecture described above). Three of the original
seven are now built; the rest are ordered roughly by how directly each follows from an existing
finding here, not by priority.

**Built since this list was first written:**

- ~~ReLU hidden-layer activation~~ - built as `ReLUBackpropClassifierNetwork` (see
  `research-and-analysis.md`'s "ReLU hidden-layer activation" entry): retuned to its own learning
  rate, it doesn't just match the sigmoid baseline, it exceeds it (99.27% vs 97.80% mean on a
  fixed XOR scenario).
- ~~Momentum~~ (not originally its own item here, but the same audit series that produced this
  list also investigated it) - built as `MomentumBackpropClassifierNetwork` despite measuring as
  a null (no coefficient tested beat plain SGD - see the "momentum" entry), since it remains a
  genuine capability worth having on its own terms, e.g. for revisiting under mini-batch
  gradients below.
- ~~L2 weight regularization~~ - built as `L2RegularizedBackpropClassifierNetwork` (see the "L2
  weight regularization" entry): also measured as a null on the proxy tested (no coefficient
  improved held-out accuracy over the unregularized baseline), kept for the same reason as
  momentum.

**Still open:**

- **Mini-batch gradient descent** (average the gradient over a small batch before each weight
  update, instead of this codebase's current pure per-example online SGD) - directly relevant to
  momentum's own open question: momentum was measured to fail here specifically because
  per-example gradients are noisy (see `research-and-analysis.md`'s "momentum" entry); mini-batching
  is the standard fix for exactly that noise source, and `MomentumBackpropClassifierNetwork`
  already exists to retest against once it does, rather than needing its own new prototype.
- **CI** (e.g. GitHub Actions running `pytest` on push/PR) - the one item here that's pure
  engineering, not ML content. Nothing currently protects this test suite (225 tests as of this
  writing, many pinned to hand-derived or empirically-measured expected values) from silently
  regressing.
- **Convolutional layers, from scratch** - a substantial but well-motivated next architecture
  step for a codebase whose only two real datasets (UCI digits, MNIST) are both images, currently
  classified with dense layers alone. Matches this repo's own pattern of progressively more
  capable model classes (`LinearClassifierNetwork` -> `BackpropClassifierNetwork` -> multi-class
  siblings) and its "hand-build everything, no ML framework" identity - a bigger effort than
  anything above, needing new node/layer abstractions for 2D receptive fields and weight sharing.
- **Softmax multiclass training on real full-scale MNIST** (currently only validated on the
  small UCI digits set - see the "softmax/cross-entropy re-alignment" entry) - would directly
  compare against the ensemble's 96.01%, but a single joint 10-output network can't be
  parallelized across processes the way the ensemble was specifically built to allow (see
  "parallelizing MNIST training"), so pure-Python training time at that scale is a real,
  unmeasured risk before committing effort to it, not a formality.
- **NumPy vectorization** - would meaningfully speed up training (the ~30-minute MNIST ensemble
  runs are pure-Python-bound), but this repo's stated identity is explicitly "no ML framework
  dependency, everything hand-built." NumPy isn't itself an ML framework, but adding any array
  library is a values question for whoever maintains this repo to decide deliberately, not
  something to assume is wanted just because it would be faster - flagged, not recommended
  outright.
