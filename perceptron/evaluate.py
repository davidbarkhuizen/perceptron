    Returns (positive_states, negative_states), each exactly count states classifier
    classifies as that class.

    Positive states are drawn from a tight box around classifier's own positive region when
    one is computable (see geometry.positive_region_bounding_box), rather than
    classifier.input_bounds - the positive region can be a tiny fraction of input_bounds
    (verified: often under 1% of the box's area at cardinality 4, as low as 0.02%), making
    naive uniform rejection sampling over the whole box prohibitively inefficient or outright
    unreachable within max_attempts. Falls back to input_bounds when no tight box is
    computable (dimension != 2, a non-AND combination, or the region isn't bounded) - exactly
    reproducing the previous, unoptimised behaviour for those cases.

    Negative states are always drawn from input_bounds - not currently a bottleneck, since a
    small positive region implies a large complementary negative one.
