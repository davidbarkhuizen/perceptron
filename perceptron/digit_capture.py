    Returns a new capture grid (grid itself is left untouched) with a radius-cell square brush
    stamped fully on, centered at (row, col), clipped to the grid's bounds.

    Needed because a single mouse-driven cell toggle only ever paints a stroke 1 capture-cell
    wide - once downsample_to_target_grid block-counts that down, it comes out far fainter
    (measured directly: ~25% of full intensity at best) than any real training example, which
    are consistently near-full intensity (~14-16 out of 16) throughout their stroked regions -
    real NIST pen strokes are proportionally thick relative to the 32x32 capture resolution,
    not single-pixel-thin, and a classifier fed input this faint from what it actually trained
    on will misclassify almost everything, usually toward whichever class's decision region
    happens to catch faint, ambiguous input (observed directly: nearly always "7").

    This brush size (radius=2, a 5x5 stamp) was picked empirically, not guessed: it reliably
    reaches near-full block intensity along a stroke's core while still leaving room for a real
    digit's negative space - e.g. an unfilled "0"'s hole. A radius of 3 or more starts filling
    that hole in too, which visibly hurts classification (a hand-simulated "0" correctly
    classified at radius=2 misclassified as "4" at radius=3 and radius=4, in testing before
    this constant was chosen).
