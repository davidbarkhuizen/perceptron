    SoftmaxOutputNode.compute_output_delta uses for the multi-class case. Unlike softmax, a

    already exactly what this loss function needs; only the node's delta computation differs.

class BinaryCrossEntropyBackpropClassifierNetwork(BackpropClassifierNetwork):
    """
    A binary cross-entropy sibling of BackpropClassifierNetwork, aligned with the canonical
    binary classification treatment rather than that class's quadratic (MSE) loss - see its own
    docstring. Structurally this is a single class-attribute override
    (output_layer_cls = CrossEntropyOutputLayer), the same pattern
    SoftmaxMultiClassBackpropClassifierNetwork uses for the multi-class case: every other method
    (learn/_backward/randomize/randomized/snapshot/restore) is inherited unchanged and stays
    correct, since cross-entropy's delta is exactly as per-node-independent as quadratic loss's.

    Unlike the multi-class case, this is NOT a drop-in improvement at BackpropClassifierNetwork's
    existing tuned learning rates - measured directly (see docs/research-and-analysis.md's
    "binary cross-entropy for BackpropClassifierNetwork" entry): at the demo-tuned
    learning_rate=1.0 this class trains to a meaningfully *lower* training accuracy than
    BackpropClassifierNetwork on the same target (91.87% vs 97.80% mean over 10 seeds on a
    fixed XOR scenario), because cross-entropy's larger, undamped gradient overshoots at that
    step size. A learning-rate sweep on the same scenario found learning_rate=0.1 brings this
    class's mean training accuracy back up to 97.60%, matching the sibling's tuned performance -
    so this class needs its own, typically substantially lower, learning_rate tuned per use,
    not whatever value already works for BackpropClassifierNetwork.

    Deliberately not a replacement for BackpropClassifierNetwork, and not (yet) used by
    EnsembleBackpropClassifierNetwork's sub-networks or any existing demo - see the same docs
    entry for why extending this to real-MNIST ensemble training is separate, dedicated future
    work, not assumed to transfer from the toy problem measured here.
